# hello-world
My first repository
I'm a career-changer, leaving the nonprofit fundraising world after 15 or so years. I'm learning to code, which includes learning to use git and GitHub. I'm also learning javascript, wordpress, php and more.  I don't know if I want to be a freelancer or get a job somewhere.  Right now I'm just learning and working on my portfolio.
